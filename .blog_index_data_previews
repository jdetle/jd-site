When great engineering teams successfully collaborate, the result is a well built product that satisfies company objectives. What I was calling 'over-engineering' happened when workers sought out and attached themselves to complex issues without thoughtful attempts to reduce their complexity."]]]},"nginx-cors-cookies":{"id":"2b478248-c836-48d4-91fc-0332eb364af7","Property":null,"Slug":"nginx-cors-cookies","Preview":null,"Date":1585760400532,"Authors":["799a8ca8-333f-497b-a92c-1fc8052e477a"],"Published":"Yes","Page":"CORS and SameSite Cookies Got You Down?

Sometimes we happen to stumble upon interesting patterns, think they're elegant, and get attached to them rather than using the solution that performs better. In the course of building a file directory, I gleaned some interesting insights into recursion, search, memoization, virtualization, and generator functions. The path getting there exposed me to concepts that I haven't really dealt with since my algorithms course in college. Fortunately, my first slow-but-elegant solution, a recursive react component, was supplanted by the use of generator functions in "],["react-vtree",[["c"]]],[", an equally interesting technology. Dealing with folder-based file systems has been one of the more rewarding small features I've had the opportunity to work in my short career."]]]},"react-route-location-state":{"id":"75e70d44-4673-42a9-9902-94c501ab7da7","Property":null,"Slug":"react-route-location-state","Preview":null,"Date":1574704800532,"Authors":["799a8ca8-333f-497b-a92c-1fc8052e477a"],"Published":"Yes","Page":"Cant use the blessed approach just yet?
